cvs2htmltable
=============

Learning the Drag &amp; Drop &amp; FileReader API I created what's hopefully a useful tool. 

### Usage

Drop & Drop the CSV file, th's & td's are contenteditable so edit away and use the button to copy to your clipboard. 

NB. I've only tested this in Chrome and since it uses newer HTML5 features like Drag & Drop & the FileReader API it probably won't work in anything else.
